# Quantitative Text Analysis of Citizenship Amendment Act

These code files are part of my MSc Applied Social Science thesis on Citizenship Amendment Analysis. 
In this topic, following three broad questions were explored:

1. How did the Pro CAA and Anti CAA groups characterized the Act and the related events?

Hypothesis 1 - The popular terms in tweets are a reflection of news events in real time. 

Hypothesis 2 - A very few users create bulk of the tweets during politically charged events. And most users engage in copy pasting or broadcasting the 
available content.
